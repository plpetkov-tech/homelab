# Fix Longhorn conversion webhook issue that causes API server overload
#
# ISSUE: Longhorn v1.10.0 has a broken conversion webhook (port 9501) that doesn't start
# but the CRDs are configured to use it. This causes the API server to continuously
# hammer the missing webhook, consuming 50%+ of control plane RAM and causing cluster
# instability (timeouts, failed deployments, controller-manager crashloops).
#
# SOLUTION: Remove the conversion webhook configuration from all Longhorn CRDs.
